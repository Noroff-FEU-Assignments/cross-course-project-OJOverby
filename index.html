    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        To protect your site in the best possible way you should follow the best practices for web security. <br><br>
Include everyone in the team in the responsibility for a secure site instead of just a dedicated security team. This way you remove bottlenecks in the development process and itâ€™s easier to scale as the business grows. This requires a lot of time and effort but pays off in the long run.<br><br>
You should adopt a cybersecurity framework, with research on security risks and an incident response plan for problems that can occur. <br><br>
By automate and integrate security tools such as vulnerability trackers and issue trackers you remove a lot of manual labor and remove a lot of human error. Problems can be detected and dealt with early in the development process.<br><br>
Make sure your developer knows the common practices to avoid potential security issues like SQL injections, cross-site scripting and cross site request forgery. <br><br>
Make sure to use diverse security measures and perform security exercises. Hire others to test the security of your site by attacking it.<br>
